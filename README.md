# Kubling Engine Core and Client
[![Kubling license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](LICENSE)

This repository contains Kubling common core datatypes, and other modules for connecting to the Engine.

## Versioning
Please note that even though the Engine uses the `common-core` and `client`, this is an independent project of `Kubling` server,
with its own release cycles.
<br>
The versions of libraries contained in this repo might not match with the version of the `Kubling` server,
for that reason each server release will specify what `common-core` and `client` versions were used for building.
