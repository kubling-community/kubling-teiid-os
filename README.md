# Kubling Engine Core and Client
[![Kubling license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](LICENSE)

This repository contains Kubling common core datatypes, and other modules for connecting to the Engine.

## Versioning
Please note that, although the Engine utilizes the `common-core` and `client` libraries, this is an independent 
project from the `Kubling` server, with its own release cycles.

The versions of the libraries in this repository may not align with the version of the `Kubling` server.  
To address this, each server release will explicitly specify the versions of `common-core` and `client` used during its build process.
